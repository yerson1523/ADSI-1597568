What is a multidimensional array? 

Create an array
In compact notation, arrays are created using brackets ([]).

To refer to the individual values ​​of the matrix, indices should be used, which are written in brackets ([]). If other index values ​​have not been specified when creating the matrix, the first term has the index [0], the second has the index [1], etc .:

PHP replaces references to values ​​of one-dimensional arrays within strings, so it is not necessary to concatenate strings and references to arrays/*
